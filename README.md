## Description
An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Server is operation, however deleting notes is not available. I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to read and write files using fs. I based my project off the 'Hot Restaurant' code from Week 11 - Day 3 Activity. However, the array used to display data is in a javascript file not a json file which confused me on how to try and replicate the read and write functions of 'Hot Restaurant' for this homework. I will seek help in this area so that I can properly understand and improve.
    
## Installation
First install the npms in the terminal by typing... "npm i", then intiate... 'npm init', type in 'node .\server.js' to start the server and then open your broswer of choice and type 'localhost:4040'.
    
## Usage
To write notes for everyday activities, that you can either save or delete.
    
## Contributors
Improve the code and keep it clean.
